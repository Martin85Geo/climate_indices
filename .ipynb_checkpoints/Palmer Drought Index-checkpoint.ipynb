    "# Palmer Drought Indices\n",
    "The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) was devised ([Palmer, 1965](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/docs/palmer.pdf)) to represent the severity of dry and wet spells over the U.S. based on monthly temperature and precipitation data as well as the soil-water holding capacity at that location. By computing empirical constants for the climatic characteristic and duration factors used in the computation of the PDSI, we provide a self-calibrated PDSI ([Wells, 2004](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2004)017%3C2335:ASPDSI%3E2.0.CO;2))\n",

    "### Water Balance Accounting\n",
    "Each month of every year, four values related to the soil moisture are computed along with their complementary potential values. These eight values are evapotranspiration (ET), recharge (R), runoff (RO), loss (L), potential evapotranspiration (PE), potential recharge (PR), potential runoff (PRO), and potential loss (PL). The potential evapotranspiration is estimated using Thornthwaite's method (Thornthwaite 1948). The calculation of these values depends heavily on the available water holding capacity (AWC) of the soil. The PDSI itself depends on a two-stage “bucket” model of the soil. The top layer of soil is assumed to hold one inch of moisture. The amount of moisture that can be held by the rest of the underlying soil is a location-dependent value, which must be provided as an input parameter to the program (AWC)."
